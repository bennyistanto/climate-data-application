Project: [SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICE GROUP FLAGSHIP REPORT ON MAKING CITIES GREEN, RESILIENT AND INCLUSIVE (P177249)](http://operationsportal.worldbank.org/secure/P177249/home)

The activity will consist of the preparation of a Global Flagship report, the preliminary working title of which is Surviving to Thriving: Making Cities Green, Resilient, and Inclusive. In addition to synthesizing insights from existing literature, preparation of the report will be informed by background research aimed at filling key empirical knowledge gaps that will help to inform the reportâ€™s discussion of institutional reforms and policies for promoting green, resilient, and inclusive urban development.
