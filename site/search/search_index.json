Mapping the extent of a natural hazard (e.g., assessing areas with a high risk) or disaster is a first step in disaster risk management and emergency response. Subsequently, exposure mapping enables the estimation of the impact of hazards or disasters, for example, regarding the number of affected inhabitants or infrastructure. This section describes in detail list of data provider, derived products, step-by-step to do the analysis and some example of use case of the data, to meet the user requirements of the GOST team of the World Bank at country, regional and global level. Contents Currently, GOST Climate contains: Data The climate are varies by location and by time of year. Daily and monthly rainfall, monthly temperature and potential evapotranspiration are a few of the many datasets from various data providers. Climate Indices A climate index is here defined as a calculated value that can be used to describe the state and the changes in the climate system. Climate indices allow a statistical study of variations of the dependent climatological aspects, such as analysis and comparison of time series, means, extremes and trends. How-to guides You will find step-by-step guideline to calculate climate indices, and can try different (data source and format) approach in How-to? section.

This step-by-step guide was tested using Mac mini Server - Late 2012, 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, running on macOS Catalina 10.15.7 and Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled running on Parallels Desktop. 0. Working Directory For this tutorial, we are working on these folder /Users/gost/temp/terraclimate/spei/ (applied to Mac/Linux machine) or Z:/temp/terraclimate/spei/ (applied to Windows machine) directory. I have some folder inside this directory: downloads ppt nc_original nc_merge nc_tiles nc_subset nc_llt Place to put netCDF's ppt data that will use as an input pet nc_original nc_merge nc_tiles nc_subset nc_llt Place to put netCDF's pet data that will use as an input Place to put downloaded TerraCLimate data, and pre-process temporary files. output nc_original Output folder for SPEI calculation gamma pearson nc_tll Temporary for nc files from NCO arrange dimension process nc_merge Merging nc from separate tiles into single global layer (if you are following the global analysis procedures) geotiff gamma Final output of SPEI, generate by CDO and GDAL Feel free to use your own preferences for this setting/folder arrangements. 1. Preparing input SPEI requires monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data, for better result, SPEI required minimum 30-years of data. If you are prefer to use your own dataset also fine, you can still follow this guideline and adjust some steps and code related to filename, unit, format and structure. 1.1. Input requirement The climate-indices python package enables the user to calculate SPEI using any gridded netCDF dataset. However, there are certain requirements for input files that vary based on input type. Precipitation and potential evapotranspiration unit must be written as millimeters , millimeter , mm , inches , inch or in . Data dimension and order must be written as lat , lon , time (Windows machine required this order) or time , lat , lon (Works tested on Mac/Linux and Linux running on WSL). If your study area are big, it's better to prepare all the data following this dimension order: lat , lon , time as all the data will force following this order during SPEI calculation by NCO module. Let say you only prepare the data as is (leaving the order to lat , lon , time ), it also acceptable but it will required lot of memory to use re-ordering the dimension, and usually NCO couldn't handle all the process and failed. 1.2. Download TerraClimate data There are 2 files contains link for downloading ppt ( https://github.com/worldbank/GOST_Climate/blob/main/downloads/ppt/nc_original/data_ppt.sh and pet ( https://github.com/worldbank/GOST_Climate/blob/main/downloads/pet/nc_original/data_pet.sh ), the folder location are exactly the same with the working directory above. Download both files and put it in the same location with your working directory. Navigate to downloads/terraclimate/ppt/nc_original and downloads/terraclimate/pet/nc_original folder in the working directory. Download using wget all TerraClimate in netCDF format from Jan 1958 to Dec 2020 (this is lot of data, ppt +- 7.7GB and pet +- 6.4GB, please make sure you have bandwidth and unlimited data package). Paste and Enter below script in your Terminal. If you are in downloads/terraclimate/ppt/nc_original then execute below command sh data_ppt.sh If you are in downloads/terraclimate/pet/nc_original then execute below command sh data_pet.sh NOTE: This guideline provide example on how to use CDO and NCO to do some data extraction process, you can choose which one is suits you. 1.3. Clip data using a bounding box based on area of interest and merge netCDFs into single netCDF Clip your area of interest using bounding box. We will use Sao Tome and Principe (STP) as the example case. Example: (STP) bounding box with format lon1 , lon2 , lat1 , lat2 is 5.75 , 8.05 , -0.35 , 2.15 Precipitation: Navigate your location to /downloads/ppt/nc_original CDO script: for fl in *.nc ; cdo sellonlatbox,5.75,8.05,-0.35,2.15 $fl ../nc_subset/ \"stp_cli_\" $fl ; done NCO script: for fl in *.nc ; ncks -d latitude,-0.35,2.15 -d longitude,5.75,8.05 $fl -O ../nc_subset/ \"stp_cli_\" $fl ; done Potential Evapotranspiration: Navigate your location to /downloads/pet/nc_original CDO script: for fl in *.nc ; cdo sellonlatbox,5.75,8.05,-0.35,2.15 $fl ../nc_subset/ \"stp_cli_\" $fl ; done NCO script: for fl in *.nc ; ncks -d latitude,-0.35,2.15 -d longitude,5.75,8.05 $fl -O ../nc_subset/ \"stp_cli_\" $fl ; done Merge all annual netcdf in a folder into single netcdf. Precipitation: make sure you are in /downloads/ppt/nc_subset CDO script: cdo mergetime stp_*.nc ../nc_merge/stp_cli_terraclimate_ppt_1958_2020.nc NCO script: Before merging the data, NCO required all the data has time dimension, we will use ncks command to make time the record dimension/variable used for concatenating files. for fl in *.nc ; do ncks -O --mk_rec_dmn time $fl $fl ; done Then we are ready to concatenate it. ncrcat -O -h stp_*.nc ../nc_merge/stp_cli_terraclimate_ppt_1958_2020.nc Potential Evapotranspiration: make sure you are in /downloads/pet/nc_subset CDO script: cdo mergetime stp_*.nc ../nc_merge/stp_cli_terraclimate_pet_1958_2020.nc NCO script: Before merging the data, NCO required all the data has time dimension, we will use ncks command to make time the record dimension/variable used for concatenating files. for fl in *.nc ; do ncks -O --mk_rec_dmn time $fl $fl ; done Then we are ready to concatenate it. ncrcat -O -h stp_*.nc ../nc_merge/stp_cli_terraclimate_pet_1958_2020.nc 1.4. Check variable and attribute As explain in Step 1.1. Input requirement above, we need to check the variable and attribute on above result to make sure all meet the requirements. Navigate to /downloads/ppt/nc_merge folder in the working directory. Then execute below command. ncdump -h stp_cli_terraclimate_ppt_1958_2020.nc Navigate to /downloads/pet/nc_merge folder in the working directory. Then execute below command. ncdump -h stp_cli_terraclimate_pet_1958_2020.nc As you can see from above picture, all the requirement is completed: unit is in mm , order dimension for each variables is lat , lon , time , and time dimension is in UNLIMITED . Once this has completed, the dataset can be used as input to climate-indices package for computing SPEI. 2. Calculate SPEI Please make sure below points: You are still inside climate_indices environment to start working on SPEI calculation. Variable name on precipitation --var_name_precip , usually TerraClimate data use ppt as name while other precipitation data like CHIRPS using precip and IMERG using precipitation as a variable name. To make sure, check using command ncdump -h file.nc then adjust it in SPEI script if needed. Variable name on potential evapotranspiration --var_name_pet , usually TerraClimate data use pet as name. Precipitation and potential evapotranspiration unit must be written as millimeters , milimeter , mm , inches , inch or in . Data dimension and order must be written as lat , lon , time (Windows machine required this order) or time , lat , lon (Works tested on Mac/Linux and Linux running on WSL). Let's start the calculation! In your Terminal, run the following code. process_climate_indices --index spei --periodicity monthly --netcdf_precip /Users/gost/temp/terraclimate/spei/downloads/ppt/nc_merge/stp_cli_terraclimate_ppt_1958_2020.nc --var_name_precip ppt --netcdf_pet /Users/gost/temp/terraclimate/spei/downloads/pet/nc_merge/stp_cli_terraclimate_pet_1958_2020.nc --var_name_pet pet --output_file_base /Users/gost/temp/terraclimate/spei/output/nc_original/spt_cli_spei --scales 1 2 3 6 9 12 18 24 36 48 60 72 --calibration_start_year 1958 --calibration_end_year 2020 --multiprocessing all Above code is example for calculating SPEI 1 to 72-months. It's ok if you think you only need some of them. Example: you are interested to calculate SPEI 1 - 3-months or SPEI 12-months, then adjust above code into --scales 1 2 3 or --scales 12 . The above command will compute SPEI (both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions) from monthly precipitation dataset and potential evapotranspiration, and the calibration period used will be Jan-1958 through Dec-2020.

The SPEI is designed to take into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) in determining drought.

The SPEI can measure drought severity according to its intensity and duration, and can identify the onset and end of drought episodes. The SPEI allows comparison of drought severity through time and space, since it can be calculated over a wide range of climates, as can the SPI.

Thus, precipitation (accumulated over a period of time) in the SPEI stands for the water availability, while ETo stands for the atmospheric water demand. Negative SPEI values represent rainfall deficit and less than median precipitation, and high potential epotranspiration (Dry), starts when the SPEI value is equal or below -1.0.

This long-term record is fitted to a probability distribution, which is then transformed into a normal distribution so that the mean SPI for the location and desired period is zero. Negative SPI values represent rainfall deficit and less than median precipitation (Dry), starts when the SPI value is equal or below -1.0. Whereas positive SPI values indicate rainfall surplus and greater than median precipitation (Wet), starts when the SPI value is equal or above 1.0, and ends when the value becomes negative. How it works Precipitation is normalized using a probability distribution function so that values of SPI are actually seen as standard deviations from the median. A normalized distribution allows for estimation of both dry and wet periods. Accumulated values can be used to analyse drought severity (magnitude). At least 30 years of continuous monthly precipitation data are needed but longer-term records would be preferable. SPI timescale intervals shorter than 1 month and longer than 24 months may be unreliable. It is spatially invariant in its interpretation.
